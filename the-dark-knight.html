          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            A gang of masked criminals robs a mafia-owned bank in Gotham City,
            each betraying the others until the sole survivor, the Joker,
            reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money. The
            vigilante Batman, district attorney Harvey Dent, and police
            lieutenant Jim Gordon form an alliance to eliminate Gotham's
            organized crime. Batman's alter-ego, the billionaire Bruce Wayne,
            publicly supports Dent as Gotham's legitimate protector, believing
            his success will allow Batman to retire so Wayne can romantically
            pursue his childhood friend Rachel Dawes, despite her relationship
            with Dent. <br /><br />
            The mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations
            from the police, Batman, and the Joker. The Joker interrupts the
            meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their
            accountant, Lau, concealed before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid
            extradition. With the help of Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox,
            Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of
            Gotham police, and his testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime
            families. The bosses accept the Joker's offer and he kills
            high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and
            police commissioner; Gordon sacrifices himself to save the mayor.
            The Joker threatens his attacks will continue until Batman unmasks.
            The Joker targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel out
            of a window, but Batman rescues her. <br /><br />
            Wayne struggles to understand the Joker's motives, but his butler
            Alfred Pennyworth says some simply relish destruction. Dent claims
            he is Batman to lure out the Joker, who attacks the police convoy
            transporting him. Batman and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehend
            the Joker, and Gordon is promoted to commissioner. At the police
            station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds Batman
            entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced
            Batman's feelings for Rachel, the Joker reveals she and Dent are
            being separately held in buildings that are rigged to explode.
            Batman races to save Rachel while Gordon goes after Dent, but they
            discover the Joker has switched their positions. Rachel is killed in
            the explosion, while Dent's face is severely burned on one side. The
            Joker escapes custody, extracts the fortune's location from Lau, and
            burns all of it. <br /><br />
            Wayne Enterprises accountant Coleman Reese deduces Batman's identity
            and attempts to expose it, but the Joker threatens to blow up a
            hospital unless Reese is killed. While the police evacuate hospitals
            and Gordon struggles to keep Reese alive, the Joker meets with a
            disillusioned Dent, persuading him to take justice into his own
            hands and avenge Rachel. Dent defers his decision-making to his
            half-scarred, two-headed coin, killing the corrupt officers and
            mafiosi who contributed to Rachel's death. As panic grips the city,
            the Joker reveals two evacuation ferries, one carrying civilians and
            the other prisoners, are rigged to explode at midnight unless one
            group sacrifices the other. To the Joker's disbelief, the passengers
            refuse to kill one another. Batman subdues the Joker but refuses to
            kill him. Before the police arrest the Joker, he says although
            Batman proved incorruptible, his plan to corrupt Dent has succeeded.
            <br /><br />
            Dent takes Gordon's family hostage, blaming his negligence for
            Rachel's death. He flips his coin to decide their fates but Batman
            tackles him to save Gordon's son, and Dent falls to his death.
            Believing Dent is the hero the city needs, Batman takes the blame
            for his death and actions, and persuades Gordon to conceal the
            truth. Pennyworth burns an undelivered message to Wayne from Rachel,
            who said she chose Dent, and Fox destroys the invasive surveillance
            network that helped Batman find the Joker. The city mourns Dent as a
            hero and the police launch a manhunt for Batman.
